## Lesson 2: Play and Games

* Play is more spontaneous
* Games have structure: rules, goals, effort from the player
* In the Magic Circle, certain activities are permitted, while others are not. This is why Huizinga viewed as 
important to establishing the circle Callois taxonomy
* Taxonomy categorizes a game based on whether it has rules, outcomes, goals, interactivity, story, etc
* Competition is often mentioned in Huizinga’s theories on play and culture. How does Caillois disagree with 
Huizinga on this point? - Play does not necessarily need to be competitive

Lesson 3: Emergent and Progressive Gamplay
+++++++

Juul argues that games can be analyzed in terms of two basic game structures: emergence and progression.

Progressive
=========
* Progressive games lead the user through the "suggested" path, Emergent let the user to set their own goals
* Rules are essential in games and above discussion: clear and applicable
* Rules construct a particular game state
* Game state provides opportunity for choices
* Within the context of the rules, working towards a positive outcome means expending effort (effort to win)
* Gameplay is trying to overcoming challenges presented by the rules

* progressive because you progress as designers intended

Emergent
========
*Playing within constraint rule systems still allows for complex game experiences and enhace user creativity
*An emergent game rule set can create a play space (less game and more play spaces)

1. Simple rules can produce emergent play (ej pong)
2. Some games are more emergent play spaces than game spaces (ej minecraft creative mode)
3. Satisfying game experiences can emerge from the experience prescribed by the designer (draw pictures with tetris)

Four ways in which emergence contributes to gameplay experiences:
1. Emergence as variation: Infinite game states can appear in a game (pong)
2. Emergence as patterns: Time spent in a game will all be repeatable patterns (fighting game)
3. Emergence as irreducibility: Playing the game is the only way to reveal surprises and unexpected aspects of the gameplay
4. Emergence as novelty (or surprise): A wholy unexpected happen in the game 

Particular forms of play in emergent games
1. Griefing: is the act of intentionally disrupt or harass other player outside of the assumed gameplay interactions
2. Speed Run: consist in complete the game or levels of the game as fast as possible at the expense of other things. It requires deep familiarity with game mechanics, expert route planning and glitch explotaition
