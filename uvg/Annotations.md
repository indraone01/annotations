## Lesson 2: Play and Games

* Play is more spontaneous
* Games have structure: rules, goals, effort from the player
* In the Magic Circle, certain activities are permitted, while others are not. This is why Huizinga viewed as 
important to establishing the circle Callois taxonomy
* Taxonomy categorizes a game based on whether it has rules, outcomes, goals, interactivity, story, etc
* Competition is often mentioned in Huizinga’s theories on play and culture. How does Caillois disagree with 
Huizinga on this point? - Play does not necessarily need to be competitive
