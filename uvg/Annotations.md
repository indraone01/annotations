## Lesson 2: Play and Games

* Play is more spontaneous
* Games have structure: rules, goals, effort from the player
* In the Magic Circle, certain activities are permitted, while others are not. This is why Huizinga viewed as 
important to establishing the circle Callois taxonomy
* Taxonomy categorizes a game based on whether it has rules, outcomes, goals, interactivity, story, etc
* Competition is often mentioned in Huizinga's theories on play and culture. How does Caillois disagree with 
Huizinga on this point? - Play does not necessarily need to be competitive

## Lesson 3: Emergent and Progressive Gameplay

Juul argues that games can be analyzed in terms of two basic game structures: emergence and progression.

### Progression
 * Progressive games lead the user through the "suggested" path, Emergent let the user to set their own goals
 * Rules are essential in games and above discussion: clear and applicable
 * Rules construct a particular game state
 * Game state provides opportunity for choices
 * Within the context of the rules, working towards a positive outcome means expending effort (effort to win)
 * Gameplay is trying to overcome challenges presented by the rules
 * It's progressive because you progress as designers intended

### Emergence
 * Playing within constraint rule systems still allows for complex game experiences and enhance user creativity
 * An emergent game rule set can create a play space (less game and more play spaces)
  1. Simple rules can produce emergent play (ex: pong)
  2. Some games are more emergent play spaces than game spaces (ex: minecraft creative mode)
  3. Satisfying game experiences can emerge from the experience prescribed by the designer (draw pictures with tetris)
 * Four ways in which emergence contributes to gameplay experiences:
  1. Emergence as variation: Infinite game states can appear in a game (pong)
  2. Emergence as patterns: Time spent in a game will all be repeatable patterns (fighting game)
  3. Emergence as irreducibility: Playing the game is the only way to reveal surprises and unexpected aspects of the 
  gameplay
  4. Emergence as novelty (or surprise): A wholly unexpected thing happen in the game 
 * Particular forms of play in emergent games
  1. Griefing: is the act of intentionally disrupt or harass other player outside of the assumed gameplay interactions
  2. Speed Run: consist in complete the game or levels of the game as fast as possible at the expense of other things. 
  It requires deep familiarity with game mechanics, expert route planning and glitch exploitation

## Lesson 4: Game Mechanics

A lesson that deals with the concept of the game mechanic. This term is crucial to game studies as it describes, in 
part, the manner in which the player interacts with the game.

* Arcade games should be simple to let the player jump right into the game and challenging enough to keep the player 
plumping in coin
* Arcade mechanics were designed to last about only 2 and a half minutes.
* Game mechanics need to be interesting and memorable to run on the old hardware
* According Ebert, games can not be art because they depend on interactivity from the user
* Game mechanics change the game state and the game state is the particular position and characteristics of all objects 
and environment in a particular moment of time
* Ebert believes that traditional expressive forms like paintings, novels, and films are inherently different from games. 
He believed that interactivity makes games inherently inferior to paintings, novels and film. Interactivity hands control 
of the experience and story over to the audience
* Sicart draws a parallel between object oriented programming and describing game elements. This is a useful metaphor 
for those who understand some of the fundamental concepts of programming
* Sicart believes that game mechanics are best described as verbs

Avedon has develoed a framework with ten structural elements to understand game interaction (what the game is a how 
it's played):
1. Purpose of the game
2. Procedure of action (how the player achieve the interaction, related to the controls)
3. Rules governing action
4. Number of required participants
5. Role of participants
6. Results or pay-off
7. Abilities and skills required for the action
8. Interaction patterns (identify how the player interacts with other players or with the environment)
9. Physical settings
10. Required equipment

* Game mechanics are means for interaction constraint by rules
* Game mechanics describe what a player may do, how the do it and rules that govern those actions
* According Miguel Sicart, game mechanics are methods invoked by agents, designed for interaction with the game world
* Agency means that something you do have and effect on something else

### Game Grammar

According Raph Koster, the game is a black box and the player goals is to figure out the rules hidden in the box.

### MDA

Tries to find a balance between the game designer and the player and three things mediate the designer-player 
relationship: Mechanics, Dynamics and Aesthetics. Dynamics involves how the pace and the goals of the game change over 
time, aesthetics are more how the player feel an emotional level. Mechanics are the various actions, behaviors and 
control mechanisms afforded to the player in the game context.

* If a play testing said that your game is boring (aesthetics), you need to change the game dynamics and to achieve 
that you could introduce a new mechanics to the game.
* According Jesse Schell, interactions and relationships that remain when all of the aesthetics, technology and story 
are stripped away
* Functional space describes the meaningful positions that game objects can be in
* Chance mechanics are those that use some degree of probability

And finally, we look at Jesse Schell’s framework for understanding games, which is a very structuralist approach to 
games. He starts by saying that game mechanics are the "interactions and relationships that remain when all of the 
aesthetics, technology and story are stripped away".

### Narrative Mechanics

Koster says that narrative in a game is not a game mechanics but a form of feedback, however this is pretty dramatic. 
Cutscenes are feedback as reward to the player for understanding game mechanics.

* Emergent narrative is created through the game, like rogue-like games. The entire history emerges from randomly 
generated elements and the player choices
* Game mechanics are really effective delivering game narrative, you can shape narrative elements through mechanics
* Extra Creditz about Narrative Mechanics

### Mechanic Interaction
* Some pretty complex gameplay can emerge from the interaction of very simple mechanics


## Lesson 5: Story and Games

Lesson 5 addresses how narrative functions in games, which is both similar and different to how it functions in movies 
or television.

Games as interactive playful objects is not the only way to understand games. Videogames can be interpreted as stories.

Why theorist focus on narrative:

1. Stories are essential to understand our past and our present
2. Academics have developed pretty comprehensive frameworks for understanding these structures and significative 
stories. Critical tools adapted to interpret videogames (structuralism, post-structuralism, deconstructionism). They 
see a videogame like a text
3. Study videogames within institutions that may not see a videogame as an important object to study

We study five important points in RPGs:
1. Why story is an important element to understand videogames
2. Discuss three basic elements of the story: character, plot and genre
3. How this three elements become a common structure to telling stories
4. We'll examine one popular story structure called The Hero's Journey
5. Finally we will explore how these structures hold up when used to understand videogames

We use three thing to help build up a narrative structure to help us understand stories in videogame:

* **Characters**: namely the heroes (protagonists), villains (antagonists), and sidekicks (tritagonists) who act and make 
decisions in the story
* **Plot**: namely the action that unfolds over time
* **Genre**: namely the accepted style and setting in which the action takes place

Narratology is story based approach to understand games, they see story as essential to creating meaning from a game.

### Character

A story has a protagonist (a greek word that means the first contestant) and an antagonist (a greek word that means 
someone to one has to compete to) and sometimes a tritagonist that is a third person who sets between the hero and the 
villan, provides the writers with a handy and consistent mechanism for advancing the game's plot and theme.

### Plot

Is the action that unfolds over time. A chronicle is a sequence of facts but plot implies design, causation and 
connections. Plot don't have to be expressed in complete linear fashion.

According to Gustav Freytag, plays has something called dramatic arc that is broke down into five separated but related 
acts.
1. **Exposition**: The main characters are introduced and the protagonist is given his/her quest or motivation that will 
drive him/her toward some goals
2. **Rising action**: This is where the main objectives start to reveal and a series of small struggles start to impede 
those activities
3. **Climax**: Where the main struggle commences. Usually includes a fight or a battle but could also include moral 
choice or a refusal to act.
4. **Falling action**: almost all of the small struggles are resolved and the main struggle is completed. Often the 
villain reappears impeding the protagonist to win
5. **Denoument**: Where everything is wrapped up neatly for the audience. Heroes are cheered, villains are punished, 
loyalty is rewarded and betrayers are cast out.

This curve (arc) is not perfectly symmetrical, sometimes is more like a jagger mountain.

### Genre

Refers to a generally agreed upon style or set of conventions that people use to classify a medium. In all media, the 
viewer, reader or player uses their own experience and interpretation to understand what they are viewing or playing. 
Genre is particularly important for understanding stories with a hero on an epic journey.

### Monomyth

It's a metaphor for growing up, in psychological terms it describes a person's growth from youth innocence to adult 
experience. In narrative terms, the monomyth describes a hero overcoming obstacles and completing epic quests.

Campbell describes three broads stages of experience:
A. **The departure**
  1. The call to the adventure
  2. Refusal of the call: Often followed by a significant punishment
  3. Supernatural aid: Usually presented in the form of a wise old man giving a gift
  4. Crossing the first threshold: Is the first step into the unknown
  5. The belly of the whale: The user is stripped of almost all of his/her companions. This step marks the end of the 
  departure and the beginning of the initiation

B. **The initiation**: here the player is stripped of all the things he/she knows and understand to experience some 
kind of rebirth and start a new life.
  6. The road of trials: the user is in a new world that is a constant source of challenge and the player goes 
  through all kind of physical, mental, emotional or psychological trials. In some games this phase is called 
  leveling-up, gaining exp, etc. It serves as preparation for the final battle with the archenemy. According to 
  Campbell, crossing the road of trials is the symbolic commitment to the journey, it's the limit between ordinary and 
  extraordinary
  7. Meeting with the Goddess: it's a brief respite on the journey where the character may recharge a little bit, 
  usually under the figure of a mother or a true love. This goddess often gives a critical quest item
  8. The temptress: temptation that tries to pull the hero away from its original quest
  9. Atonement with the father: the hero has to realize his/her own identify, usually through the form of a 
  confrontation with someone with lot of power in the figure of a father
  10. Apotheosis: accepting the loss the character gains a broader knowledge. The hero gains the wisdom to see 
  him/herself in a new way, often the self is even sacrificed in favor of the greater good
  11. The ultimate boon: here is where the hero reconciles with the truth and give him/herself a renewed sense of 
  balance and wisdom. With the ultimate boon the hero uses their knowledge to serve a greater purpose. This boon is 
  usually mental or psychological 

C. **The return**
  12. Refusal to return: Often is punished too or the hero simply can't return home given the arduousness of the trails
  13. The magic flight: is the magical or supernatural aid that the player requires to escape
  14. Rescue from without: in case the magic flight doesn't come up, the hero could back to his/her town with any 
  other mean (magic wand, etc)
  15. Crossing the return threshold: games that go beyond the previous point must face the mark of passing from 
  darkness to light and been reborn into the world. Could imply fighting against a guardian and sometimes with words, 
  not with weapons
  16. Master of two worlds: when the hero returns home is wiser, so he/she should be able to symbolically travel back 
  and forth between home and the distant land
  17. Freedom to live: when the hero accepts the reward for completing his/her journey and is given the freedom to 
  live. It's more like a psychological stage, the hero can live in peace.

Criticism
1. Male perspective oriented. Women have a supporting role
2. To flexible and extensible, almost anything can be considered inside the paradigm
3. When used as a prescripted recipe most stories will come up as predictable and cliché

### Branching Narrative

Hypertext Fiction helped to set a standard to explore the non-linear narrative stories. Give to the player the ability 
to control the flow of the story. Games are stories, so narratologist use tools to analyze games.
