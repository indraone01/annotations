## Lesson 2: Play and Games

* Play is more spontaneous
* Games have structure: rules, goals, effort from the player
* In the Magic Circle, certain activities are permitted, while others are not. This is why Huizinga viewed as 
important to establishing the circle Callois taxonomy
* Taxonomy categorizes a game based on whether it has rules, outcomes, goals, interactivity, story, etc
* Competition is often mentioned in Huizinga's theories on play and culture. How does Caillois disagree with 
Huizinga on this point? - Play does not necessarily need to be competitive

## Lesson 3: Emergent and Progressive Gameplay

Juul argues that games can be analyzed in terms of two basic game structures: emergence and progression.

### Progression
 * Progressive games lead the user through the "suggested" path, Emergent let the user to set their own goals
 * Rules are essential in games and above discussion: clear and applicable
 * Rules construct a particular game state
 * Game state provides opportunity for choices
 * Within the context of the rules, working towards a positive outcome means expending effort (effort to win)
 * Gameplay is trying to overcome challenges presented by the rules
 * It's progressive because you progress as designers intended

### Emergence
 * Playing within constraint rule systems still allows for complex game experiences and enhance user creativity
 * An emergent game rule set can create a play space (less game and more play spaces)
  1. Simple rules can produce emergent play (ex: pong)
  2. Some games are more emergent play spaces than game spaces (ex: minecraft creative mode)
  3. Satisfying game experiences can emerge from the experience prescribed by the designer (draw pictures with tetris)
 * Four ways in which emergence contributes to gameplay experiences:
  1. Emergence as variation: Infinite game states can appear in a game (pong)
  2. Emergence as patterns: Time spent in a game will all be repeatable patterns (fighting game)
  3. Emergence as irreducibility: Playing the game is the only way to reveal surprises and unexpected aspects of the 
  gameplay
  4. Emergence as novelty (or surprise): A wholly unexpected thing happen in the game 
 * Particular forms of play in emergent games
  1. Griefing: is the act of intentionally disrupt or harass other player outside of the assumed gameplay interactions
  2. Speed Run: consist in complete the game or levels of the game as fast as possible at the expense of other things. 
  It requires deep familiarity with game mechanics, expert route planning and glitch exploitation

## Lesson 4: Game Mechanics

A lesson that deals with the concept of the game mechanic. This term is crucial to game studies as it describes, in 
part, the manner in which the player interacts with the game.

* Arcade games should be simple to let the player jump right into the game and challenging enough to keep the player 
plumping in coin
* Arcade mechanics were designed to last about only 2 and a half minutes.
* Game mechanics need to be interesting and memorable to run on the old hardware
* According Ebert, games can not be art because they depend on interactivity from the user
* Game mechanics change the game state and the game state is the particular position and characteristics of all objects 
and environment in a particular moment of time
* Ebert believes that traditional expressive forms like paintings, novels, and films are inherently different from games. 
He believed that interactivity makes games inherently inferior to paintings, novels and film. Interactivity hands control 
of the experience and story over to the audience
* Sicart draws a parallel between object oriented programming and describing game elements. This is a useful metaphor 
for those who understand some of the fundamental concepts of programming
* Sicart believes that game mechanics are best described as verbs

Avedon has develoed a framework with ten structural elements to understand game interaction (what the game is a how 
it's played):
1. Purpose of the game
2. Procedure of action (how the player achieve the interaction, related to the controls)
3. Rules governing action
4. Number of required participants
5. Role of participants
6. Results or pay-off
7. Abilities and skills required for the action
8. Interaction patterns (identify how the player interacts with other players or with the environment)
9. Physical settings
10. Required equipment

* Game mechanics are means for interaction constraint by rules
* Game mechanics describe what a player may do, how the do it and rules that govern those actions
* According Miguel Sicart, game mechanics are methods invoked by agents, designed for interaction with the game world
* Agency means that something you do have and effect on something else

### Game Grammar

According Raph Koster, the game is a black box and the player goals is to figure out the rules hidden in the box.

### MDA

Tries to find a balance between the game designer and the player and three things mediate the designer-player 
relationship: Mechanics, Dynamics and Aesthetics. Dynamics involves how the pace and the goals of the game change over 
time, aesthetics are more how the player feel an emotional level. Mechanics are the various actions, behaviors and 
control mechanisms afforded to the player in the game context.

* If a play testing said that your game is boring (aesthetics), you need to change the game dynamics and to achieve 
that you could introduce a new mechanics to the game.
* According Jesse Schell, interactions and relationships that remain when all of the aesthetics, technology and story 
are stripped away
* Functional space describes the meaningful positions that game objects can be in
* Chance mechanics are those that use some degree of probability

And finally, we look at Jesse Schell’s framework for understanding games, which is a very structuralist approach to 
games. He starts by saying that game mechanics are the "interactions and relationships that remain when all of the 
aesthetics, technology and story are stripped away".

### Narrative Mechanics

Koster says that narrative in a game is not a game mechanics but a form of feedback, however this is pretty dramatic. 
Cutscenes are feedback as reward to the player for understanding game mechanics.

* Emergent narrative is created through the game, like rogue-like games. The entire history emerges from randomly 
generated elements and the player choices
* Game mechanics are really effective delivering game narrative, you can shape narrative elements through mechanics
* Extra Creditz about Narrative Mechanics

### Mechanic Interaction
* Some pretty complex gameplay can emerge from the interaction of very simple mechanics
